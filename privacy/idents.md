  - `UUID`s
    - App Generated
  - [`InstanceIds`](https://developers.google.com/instance-id/)
    - Server can use to detect app live-ness
  - `IMEI/MEIDs` and `IMSIs`
    - `Phone` perms
    - [TelephonyManager](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/telephony/TelephonyManager.html) APIs changed in O preview (method renaming)
  - `Ad Ids`
  - `SSAIDs` aka `Settings.Secure.ANDROID_ID`
    - From android O [unique](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/04/changes-to-device-identifiers-in.html) for each packagename / signing cert combo

    - By which permission can I tell that an app has access to a given identifier?
    - Possible protective measures
  - Adds to the above:
    - [Build.Serial](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build.html#getSerial())
      - Since Android 2.3 (“Gingerbread”) this is available via android.os.Build.SERIAL. Devices without telephony are required to report a unique device ID here; some phones may do so also. [android blog](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2011/03/identifying-app-installations.html)
