#KeyStore

> KeyStore is responsible for maintaining cryptographic keys and their owners.
 
and 
 
> Use the Android Keystore provider to let an individual app store its own credentials that only the app itself can access. This provides a way for apps to manage credentials that are usable only by itself while providing the same security benefits that the KeyChain API provides for system-wide credentials. This method requires no user interaction to select the credentials.

##Why should I use it?

If you need to utilise and persist a cryptographic key in your application you either need to:

1. Request some input from the user (like a password) and either use this directly to derive a key or use it to encrypt a key which can then be persisted to disk
2. Store the key securely so it cant 'easily' be snooped

Some implementations may store a key inside shared prefs or raw on the filesystem, or worse, in the source code, which is a vulnerable approach to key management. 

KeyStore allows a way to store a key in hardware (if available) or in software (as an encrypted blob based off the device lock key) making it much harder to lift keys.

This is especially handy for any kind of challenge / response auth or other process where a compromise of the key itself would cause problems.

##User Authenticating Key Use

Key authentication options are below, which the api and functionality offered differ pre and post M-23-6.

Keep in mind the different modes of usage will have have an impact of the stabilty/lifecycle of the key ([Android Security: The Forgetful Keystore](http://doridori.github.io/android-security-the-forgetful-keystore/)).

- No Auth
  - PreM
    - If [`.setEncryptionRequired()`](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/security/KeyPairGeneratorSpec.Builder.html#setEncryptionRequired()) is not set then any created keys will use NOT the keyguard input as input to the key blob KEK.
  - PostM
    - If [`.setUserAuthenticationRequired`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/security/keystore/KeyGenParameterSpec.Builder.html#setUserAuthenticationRequired(boolean)) is `false` (default) then the keys are delt in the same way as PreM.
- Keyguard Authed
  - PreM
    - If [`.setEncryptionRequired()`](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/security/KeyPairGeneratorSpec.Builder.html#setEncryptionRequired()) is set then any created keys will use the keyguard input as input to the key blob KEK. 
  - PostM
    - If [`.setUserAuthenticationRequired`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/security/keystore/KeyGenParameterSpec.Builder.html#setUserAuthenticationRequired(boolean)) is `true` and [setUserAuthenticationValidityDurationSeconds](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/security/keystore/KeyGenParameterSpec.Builder.html#setUserAuthenticationValidityDurationSeconds(int)) > 0 then auth will be required via the keyguard (either via normal unlock or app requested keyguard unlock). 
- Finger Authed
  - PreM
    - N/A 
  - PostM
    - If [`.setUserAuthenticationRequired`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/security/keystore/KeyGenParameterSpec.Builder.html#setUserAuthenticationRequired(boolean)) is `true` and [setUserAuthenticationValidityDurationSeconds](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/security/keystore/KeyGenParameterSpec.Builder.html#setUserAuthenticationValidityDurationSeconds(int)) == -1 then finger auth will be required per use

##OS Auth

- OS access auth
  - Key access is tied to the apps UID
  - If rooted any user/app can in theory assume any UID
  - Access marshalled by keystore deamon on older apis and binder server on new ones 
 
###More on `.setUserAuthenticationRequired(true)` 

If a key has been created with `.setUserAuthenticationRequired(true)` then the user has to either authenticate via 

- [`KeyGuardManager.createConfirmDeviceCredentialIntent(...)`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/KeyguardManager.html#createConfirmDeviceCredentialIntent(java.lang.CharSequence, java.lang.CharSequence)) to promt the user to enter pin, pattern or password. 
  - [ConfirmCredential](http://developer.android.com/samples/ConfirmCredential/index.html)
    - Uses `.setUserAuthenticationValidityDurationSeconds(AUTHENTICATION_DURATION_SECONDS)`  
    - This sample demonstrates how you can use device credentials (PIN, Pattern, Password) in your app to authenticate the user before they are trying to complete some actions
    - Will try to use key as part of crypto op after auth
- Fingerprint
  - Check [fingerprint.md](fingerprint.md) for more. Essentially needs to perform `KeyStore` op in fingerprint api auth callback.

##Losing Keys and how to handle

See [Android Security: The Forgetful Keystore](http://doridori.github.io/android-security-the-forgetful-keystore/) for losing Keys due to lock screen changes.

You can also lose Keys that require fingerprint auth when a new finger is enrolled. See [fingerprint.md](/api/fingerprint.md)

##Locking of Keystore

I have not encountered this myself but there are anecdontal reports of keystores becoming locked even when `setEncryptionRequired` == false. See [this SO post](http://stackoverflow.com/a/25790891/236743).

##Hardware vs Software & CTS

See [/hardware/keystore.md](/hardware/keystore.md)

##KeyMaster 

The hardware `KeyStore` is accessed through an [OEM specfific HAL](https://source.android.com/security/keystore/). There is a `softkeymaster` also.

See [android.googlesource.com](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/keymaster/+/master) for `keymaster` code. This [clone](https://github.com/geekboxzone/mmallow_system_keymaster/) maybe easier to navigate.

##CAs

CAs are also stored in the `KeyStore`. When added a custom CA device should prompt user to enter device credentials.
